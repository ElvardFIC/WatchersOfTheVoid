// coop/interactables/notebook_sync.h -- a notebook's page text across peers.
//
// The page text is the notebook's own save record (`text`, read by getData, written by loadData), which
// already crosses on the prop record lane (coop/props/prop_save_data). This module adds the editor:
//   - one editor at a time: ui_notebook_C open on a notebook holds the notebook's occupancy claim;
//   - what the editor wrote reaches the record: the editing peer publishes at the editor's close and, while it
//     holds the claim, at the editor's own commit, at most once per kPublishEvery when `text` changed;
//   - the host takes a client's record from the slot holding the claim, or from any slot while nobody does;
//   - a client lets the claim go only after the host has answered its last publish, so the close reaches
//     the host while its sender still holds; a bound makes it let go anyway;
//   - a peer holding the claim applies no record for that notebook once it has published in this claim:
//     its edit is then the newer.
// The two rules are registered with coop/props/prop_record_gates; the hold on the release and the end of a claim
// with coop/interactables/device_occupancy. The page-add verb is cancelled while another peer holds the notebook.
// Game thread throughout.
