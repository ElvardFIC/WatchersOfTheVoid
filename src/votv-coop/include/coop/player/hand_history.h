// coop/player/hand_history.h -- what each slot held in its hand, and when.
//
// A short per-slot ring of (class, from, to) entries, so the host can ask whether a slot held a class
// at any moment in the last N ms. The hand lane stamps it where it APPLIES a slot's state, never at
// receive: that lane paces its applies, so the history follows the hand the host shows. The shape is
// Source's: a per-player history the server judges an act against
// (reference/source-sdk-2013/src/game/server/player_lagcompensation.cpp). Its window there is latency plus
// interpolation, capped at 1 s (:258, :381-399); the windows asked of this one are flat: they cover the hand
// lane's pacing and, for the hand kinds, the fuse. Engine-free and wire-free; game thread only.
