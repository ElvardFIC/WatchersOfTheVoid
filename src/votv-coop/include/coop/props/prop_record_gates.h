// coop/props/prop_record_gates.h -- a class's say over a prop's save record landing (coop/props/prop_save_data).
//
// The record lane carries every covered prop's state and knows nothing of what a class does with it. A
// class that has a rule about who may write its record, or about when a record may be applied, registers
// the rule here from its own Install (the shape of prop_save_data::DeclareClassOwnedElsewhere, and for the
// same reason: the rule is declared where the class's lane lives, and the generic lane names no class).
//   - an INTENT gate: the HOST asks it before a client's record lands on an actor of the class, with the
//     slot that sent it;
//   - an APPLY gate: asked before any record is written onto an actor of the class, on any peer; false
//     drops the record (it is not parked: a gate that wants a record to wait has no use for this one).
// A gate is asked for an actor of the class or below, and may be asked more than once for one record (a
// record that fails to apply is asked again): a gate must be idempotent. Game thread.
