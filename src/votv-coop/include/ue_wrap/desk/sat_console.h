// ue_wrap/desk/sat_console.h -- the SAT console: the one ui_console_C terminal a machine's
// panel_SATconsole_C panels all show (the desk hands its atlas's umg_console to every panel as it
// begins), and terminals of our own made of the same class and never shown. A terminal runs a typed
// line through enterCommand, prints every line through writeToLog, and is busy while `processing`
// is set; a panel points it at its dish with init(name, hide, dish) and records itself in `used`.
// Engine-wrapper layer (principle 7): no network or gameplay logic.
